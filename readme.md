# 📄 Automated Metadata Generator

This is a simple and powerful tool built with Python and Streamlit that can automatically extract meaningful metadata from unstructured documents like **PDFs**, **Word files**, and **text files** — even if they contain scanned images!

## ✨ What This App Can Do

Once you upload a file, the app will:
- ✅ Extract text from PDF, DOCX, or TXT files
- ✅ Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read scanned image-based PDFs
- ✅ Identify key phrases (keywords) using the RAKE algorithm
- ✅ Highlight named entities (like people, places, dates) using spaCy
- ✅ Generate a short summary using LexRank
- ✅ Display everything cleanly in a web-based UI
